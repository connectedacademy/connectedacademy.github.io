The photo was of a motor-cross competitor taking a tumble from his motorcycle. The date, 1955. The award, the first ever World Press Photo of the Year.
Almost every year since has seen a contest and a winning image. Some of the photos have become iconic — a naked girl running after a napalm attack in Vietnam; a Buddhist monk who has set himself alight; a sole demonstrator standing in front of tanks on Tiananmen Square. Others have set trends, established styles of press photography that can be seen re-emerging in years to come. 

Each of the images below are from the World Press Photo Foundation Archive and have been reimagined as Four Corners Images. We have used the Fourcorners template to add more contextual information to these historical frames but don't feel limited by such a literal application when you come to make your Four Corners images.

This escalated into clashes between rival paramilitary factions. Greece and Turkey became increasingly embroiled in the situation. Greece sent 20,000 troops to the island, while Turkey responded to attacks on Turkish Cypriot areas with air strikes. In 1964 the United Nations sent in peacekeeping troops to support British soldiers manning the so-called \"Green Line\", set up to divide the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of Nicosia.","author":"Don McCullin","magazine":"The Observer / Quick / Life","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1964/world-press-photo-year/don-mccullin","date":"20-03-1964"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Don McCullin © 1964","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"Ghaziveram, Cyprus.
